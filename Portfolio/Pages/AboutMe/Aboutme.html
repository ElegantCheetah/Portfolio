			My Achivements:
			</h1>
		
			<body>
			One of my personal achivements is becoming the mechanical team lead of Robotics team #3243, I am happy that <br>
			I get to help around and be hands on with robots and robotic systems. Even though I am the mechanical team lead, <br>
			I want to know more about other systems and that is why I have focused on Programming, Computer Aided Design, and Electrical. <br>

			<h1>
				My Hobbies: 
			</h1>
			<body> 
				I like to race FPV (First Person View) Drones. I learn important skills of troubleshooting and fast reflexes. <br> 
				FPV racing requires a big amount of knowing how to pilot and move your drone to a specific spot very accuratly. <br> 
				I am also interested in aviation, I am currently in the process of achiving my students pilot liscence. I plan to fly <br>
				small recreational aircraft or see where this career takes me. I also have an avid enjoyment for Paramotoring which I <br> 
				hope will be in my future. With the love of Drones and Airplanes, I am a big fan of 3D printers. I have a modified <br>
				Ender-3 Pro at home. I also like to rock climb, I am new into this sport but given a few years I will be strong enough<br>
				 for the biggest climbs. I have been diving more and more into the stars and astrophotography, hopefully I will be taking <br>
				 beautiful pictures of the stars. I look forward into the future to see what other hobbies I fall into.
