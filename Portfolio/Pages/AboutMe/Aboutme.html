		<h2>
		My Achivements:
		</h2>
	
		<body>
		One of my personal achivements is becoming the mechanical team lead of Robotics team #3243, I am happy that <br>
		I get to help around and be hands on with robots and robotic systems. Even though I am the mechanical team lead, <br>
		I want to know more about other systems and that is why I have focused on Programming, Computer Aided Design, and Electrical. <br>
		</body>
		<br>

		<h2>
			My Hobbies: 
		</h2>
		<body> 
			I like to race FPV (First Person View) Drones. I learn important skills of troubleshooting and fast reflexes. <br> 
			FPV racing requires a big amount of knowing how to pilot and move your drone to a specific spot very accuratly. <br> 
			I am also interested in aviation, I am currently in the process of achiving my students pilot liscence. I plan to fly <br>
			small recreational aircraft or see where this career takes me. I also have an avid enjoyment for Paramotoring which I <br> 
			hope will be in my future. With the love of Drones and Airplanes, I am a big fan of 3D printers. I have a modified <br>
			Ender-3 Pro at home. I look forward into the future to see what other hobbies I fall into.
