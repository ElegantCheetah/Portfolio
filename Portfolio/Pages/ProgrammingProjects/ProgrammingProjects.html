						<h2>
							Coding
						</h2>

						<br> I mainly program in Python and C++ but I am also fluent in HTML, Java, and Processing. 
						<br> I know my way around a Linux system and use a Linux terminal for everyday work. 
						<br> My <a href='https://www.github.com/ZainKergayeProjects' target = '_blank'> Project GitHub </a> is filled with personal projects I either do during school or free time. 
						<br>
						<br>

						
						<h2> 
							My Contributions
						</h2>
						
						<h3>
							Portfolio
						</h3>
						<br> My personal website I made entirely from scratch, it includes my 
						<br> personal projects and the source code is all open source
						<br> <a href='https://github.com/ZainKergaye/Portfolio' target = '_blank'> https://github.com/ZainKergaye/Portfolio </a>
						<br>

						<h3>
							2021 Robot Code
						</h3>
						<br>I have helped to code a robot to compete in the <a href = 'https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc' target = '_blank'> FRC </a> robotics competition.
						<br>I am on team 3243 and i'm the mechanical team lead but i want to know more about programming and other fields in robotics.

						<h3> 
							2022 Robot Code
						</h3>
						<br>I helped to program the robot that we have built this year. This year it is designed to intake balls, automatically line up to a target to shoot, and climb.
						<br>This years code is more complex than ever using more resources from WPI Libraries.

						<h2>
							3D Computer Aided Design 
						</h2>

						<br> I use SolidWorks to design some of the things that I need in real life. It really helps me in
						<br> my robotics club and when I build and crash drones. 3D printing helpes me bring my designs to life.
						<br> I own an Ender 3 Pro to print out my designs and anything else that I need. I can rapidly prototype 
						<br> anything that I want to test. It is a great skill to know and use. I use <a href = 'https://www.thingiverse.com/zainkergaye/designs' target = '_blank'> Thingiverse </a> to post my
						<br> designs for others so hopefully find useful too.
						
						<h2> 
							My Contributions
						</h2>
						<br>
						
						<h3>
							NASA Acrylic Art Piece
						</h3>

						<br> I made an acrylic logo of NASA meant to be lit up with LED's at the bottom to appear glowing.

						<br>
						
						<h3> 
							Monitor Stand
						</h3>

						<br> I made a monitor stand that uses a spare piece of wood to elevate my monitor so I can put things below it

						<br>


						<h3>
							Poster Frame
						</h3>
						<br> I didn't like how expensive poster frames were so I decided to use some magnets laying around to make a cool clamp to let it hang.

						<h3>iPhone SE 2020 wallet case</h3>
						<br>I wanted to simplify my life with combining my wallet with my phone so its easier to not forget. I had a good challenge with designing this. 
						<br>I took a case premade off of GrabCad and added a little backplane as a wallet. It's complex to print but hopefully it will turn out to be worth it.

						<h2> 
							Future Projects
						</h2>
						
						<br>
						<br> I have many future CAD ideas to make and I will be adding them to this website as I go along.
