                    This week I made the final version to my waterbottle cap. I added a spot for my handle that was for the original cap. It turned out really nicley

					Another project I am attempting is making some rings. I know this might not sound too interesting but if I find a design I like and design it, I could machine it with real cnc machines at a machine shop. 
					I am very happy to be given this opportunity. Right now my current design relates back to the movie Interstellar. On the ring is has "... - .- -.--", this is STAY in morse. This relates personaly to me and this movie alot.

					The text may seem spread out but I am experimenting with how it should look. So far I have made and messed around with 8 or 9 different prototypes.

					Another little side project I am working on is a headband to hold Piezzo Electric Transducers to my head in the right place. So far I have made 2 prototypes regarding the size of my head.
					The current prototype is 7in in diameter. This is slightly too big. Additionally I hooked up the piezzo speakers up to an amp and they have worked beautifully. They are very fragile although. I broke 2 wires from the bare pcb that connects the coil to the wires.
